# Utility.fun: The Utility Discovery Layer 🚀

> **"Don’t just ship code. Ship a community."**

### 📋 Executive Summary
**Utility.fun** is the "Love Child" of **Product Hunt** and **Pump.fun**. We are a discovery and fair-launch pipeline built on the **BNB Chain** that turns functional software into tradable assets. We are changing the Web3 meta from betting on "cats with hats" to backing "tools with users."

---

### 📉 The Problem: The Vaporware Gap
The current market is polarized. 
* **Pump.fun** offers instant, fair-launch liquidity but 99% of tokens have zero underlying value. 
* **Product Hunt** offers real innovation and utility, but builders struggle for months to find funding or a dedicated community. 

**The result?** A market full of "rugs" and builders shouting into a void.

### 🛠 The Solution: Functional FOMO
Utility.fun replaces speculative gambling with **Proof of Product**. We make the acts of Finding, Creating, and Investing interchangeable.

#### 🔍 FIND (The Signal)
We filter the noise to surface tools that actually work.
* **Utility Leaderboard:** Daily curation of functional Web3 tools.
* **Verified Builds:** Every launch is tied to a live, functional dApp. No vaporware allowed.

#### 🏗️ BUILD (The Community)
We provide the infrastructure for developers to turn code into a self-sustaining economy.
* **Bonding Curve Launches:** Launch your utility token with instant liquidity. No VCs, no pre-sales.
* **BNB Chain Efficiency:** Built for sub-cent gas fees and massive retail liquidity.

#### 🏹 OWN (The Utility)
We turn users into stakeholders.
* **Skin in the Game:** Your "upvote" isn't just a click—it’s a stake in the tool’s future.
* **Aligned Incentives:** When the app grows, the utility grows, and the community wins.

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Deploy:** Developers link a functional dApp and launch its native utility token on a curve.
2. **Signal:** The community "hunts" and votes on the utility by participating in the bonding curve.
3. **Migrate:** Once the "Utility Curve" is filled, liquidity migrates automatically to **PancakeSwap**.
4. **Utilize:** Tokens are immediately spendable or stakeable within the creator's application.

### 🌐 The Vision
In the traditional world, you are a user. In the Utility.fun world, you are an owner. We are building the primary destination for the next generation of useful software.

**If it’s not on Utility.fun, it’s just a memecoin.**
