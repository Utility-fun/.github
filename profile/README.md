# 🚀 Utility.fun

**Don’t just ship code. Ship a community.**

Utility.fun is the discovery layer for functional Web3. We bridge the gap between "shipping an app" and "launching an economy," turning early users into vested stakeholders.

### 🔍 Find the Signal
The hunt for substance starts here. We filter the noise to surface tools that actually work.
- **Utility Leaderboard:** Daily curation of the most functional tools in Web3.
- **Proof of Product:** Every project is verified against a live, functional dApp.
- **Fair Hunt:** No VCs. No insiders. Just community-driven discovery.

### 🏹 Community & Voting
A decentralized curation engine where the community defines the standards.
- **Upload Utility:** Submit functional dApps for community review.
- **Vote & Rank:** Use utility-based signaling to promote the most valuable tools.
- **Build the Tribe:** Connect builders with "investor-users" who actually use the software.

### 🛠 For Makers
Transform your software from a repository into a self-sustaining ecosystem.
- **Community-First Launch:** Build your tribe before you build your market.
- **Reputation Engine:** Earn "Maker Status" through functional code and successful launches.
- **Stakeholder Growth:** Turn your users into owners.
